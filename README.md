Honestly, I am not very keen on the town's current touristic website, so I decided to make it a bit more fun (at least for me!), while learning ReactJS.

The app's style was built upon a bootstrap template from [Creative Tim](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/paper-kit-2) <img src="https://spng.pngfind.com/pngs/s/439-4399618_tim-logo-creative-tim-hd-png-download.png" alt="Convolutional Neural Networks diagram" style="height: 16px; width: 16px;"/>. The project renders into an `index.html` page and was deployed using <img src="https://pics.freeicons.io/uploads/icons/png/11987465721551941710-512.png" alt="Convolutional Neural Networks diagram" style="height: 16px; width: 16px;"/> [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

It is currently in progress, but you can check what I have done so far right [here](https://visit-penrith.netlify.app/)!
